## üå∏ Greetings!
Welcome to the fun world of Data Structures and Algorithms! üò∏üôåüèªü©∑

This course is designed for a comprehensive introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms, covering fundamental concepts and practical applications. You will explore various data structures such as (but not limited to), arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, and learn how to implement and utilize them efficiently. 

The course also delves into algorithm design and analysis, teaching students to develop, evaluate, and optimize algorithms for a wide range of computational problems. ü´°
